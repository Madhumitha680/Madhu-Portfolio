                <h3>Windows Server 2016 Project</h3>
                <p>This project involved setting up a complete network infrastructure using Windows Server 2016 on virtual machines (DC1, DM1, CL1, CL2).
                    I successfully configured and managed various services, including Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, WINS, RAS, and VPN. 
                    Active Directory was set up to manage user authentication, authorization, and access control within a domain environment.
                    DNS and DHCP were implemented to provide dynamic IP addressing and domain name resolution for clients in the network.
                    WINS service was configured to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses, ensuring compatibility with older applications.</p>
